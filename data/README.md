# Data
Please unzip data downloaded from the Zenodo repository into this folder.

There are 10 dataset, each corresponding to a jupyter notebook. They are labeled either as `mainXX` or `edXX`, each corresponding to a **Main Figure** or **Extended Data Figure**.

Note that some of the dataset was analyzed across different figures, hence the lack of one-to-one correspondence between actual figures and the notebooks/data folders.
